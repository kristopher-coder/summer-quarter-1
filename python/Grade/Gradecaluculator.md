An **if-statement** checks whether a specific condition is true. If it is, the code inside the if-block runs. If the condition is false, that block of code is skipped.




An **if-statement** is used to make decisions in a program. It allows the program to respond differently depending on whether a condition is true or false.





An **else-statement** provides an alternative set of instructions that run **only if the if-statement condition is false**. It acts as a fallback.




An **elif statement** (short for "else if") lets you check **another condition** if the previous `if` or `elif` was false. You can use multiple `elif` statements to test several different conditions in order.
